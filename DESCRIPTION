Title: rebi -- R Interface for Europe PMC RESTful Web Service
URL: http://github.com/njahn82/rebi/
BugReports: http://github.com/njahn82/rebi/issues
Description: R Interface to Europe PMC RESTful Web Service. Europe PMC covers
    life science literature and it gives access to open access full texts.
    Coverage is not only restricted to Europe, but articles and abstracts are
    indexed from all over the world. As a partner in the PMC International
    (PMCi), Europe PMC ingests all PubMed content and extends its index with
    other sources, including Agricola, a bibliographic database of citations to
    the agricultural literature, or Biological Patents. In addition to
    bibliographic data, rebi gives automated access to citations and references
    that were indexed by Europe PMC. Links between life-science literature and
    other EBI databases, including ENA, PDB or ChEMBL are also accessible.
    External links provide a mechanism to link out to external providers such as
    Wikipedia or research data repositories.
